Model Assumes: capital yeilds a proportional increase in number of employees, with no internal impact on productivity per employee. No depreciation, no inflation, etc. All values are multiples of worker's wages per time period, assumed to be fixed at 1.

Structurally, owners liquid assets are able to grow exponentially, wheras workers assets can only grow linearly, as they can't use money to buy more earning power. In this case, the wealth gap grows exponentially, leading inevitably to intergroup conflict
