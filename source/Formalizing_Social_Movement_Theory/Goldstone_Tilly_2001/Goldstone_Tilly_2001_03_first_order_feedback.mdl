		This file is essentially the mental model of an unsophisticated regime, which \

		- Individuals are rational actiors making cost/benefit decisions

		the current threats to the protest group, and the level of repression that \
		follows on protest action.

		increasing violence against the population or specific groups, taking away \
		rights or property, or other such actions. The state can also decrease \

		policies to improve conditions for popular and/or elite groups.'

		This fonnula involves yet another simplification - that the costs of \
		repression do not depend on the chances for success. In some cases, this \
		is clearly false - those leading a rebellion are likely to suffer far \
		greater costs if the rebellion fails than if it succeeds. However, if we \
		focus on the ordinary protestor, say the person who helped defend the \
		Russian Parliament in 1991, or the civil rights protestor who risks a \
		beating or arrest, for them the eventual result days or weeks later will \
		not change whether a bullet finds them on the barricade, or lighten the \
		beating, or avoid the arrest. For them, the immediate risks involved with \
		the act of protest itself are what counts - which is to say that leaders \
		and followers may have a separate calculus of prospective gains and risks, \
		with both being much greater for those in charge.
