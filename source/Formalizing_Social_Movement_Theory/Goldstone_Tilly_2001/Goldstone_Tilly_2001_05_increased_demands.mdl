		This file is essentially the mental model of an unsophisticated regime, which \
		considers only the direct impact of their policy.
		
		
		Model Assumptions:
		---------------------------
		- Individuals are rational actiors making cost/benefit decisions
	|

Ability to Make Concessions=
	1
	~	
	~		|

Ability to Repress=
	3
	~	
	~		|

Adjusting Repression=
	IF THEN ELSE(Protest, IF THEN ELSE( Manifest Repressive Threat Tr < Ability to Repress\
		 , Agressiveness of Response * Bias towards Repression
	 , 0 ) , 0 )
	~	
	~	The state, ... has additional options, namely its ability to manipulate \
		the current threats to the protest group, and the level of repression that \
		follows on protest action.
	|

Agressiveness of Response=
	0.25
	~	
	~		|

Bias towards Repression=
	Cost per unit Concession / (Cost per unit Concession + Cost per unit repression)
	~	
	~		|

Concessions= INTEG (
	Making Concessions,
		0)
	~	
	~	Harms under the existing regime.
		
		pg 184:
		'The state can increase prospective or current harm by increasing taxes, \
		increasing violence against the population or specific groups, taking away \
		rights or property, or other such actions. The state can also decrease \
		current or prospective harm by making concessions, that is changing its \
		policies to improve conditions for popular and/or elite groups.'
	|

Cost per unit Concession=
	1
	~	
	~		|

Cost per unit repression=
	1
	~	
	~		|

Cost to Regime=
	Concessions * Cost per unit Concession + Manifest Repressive Threat Tr * Cost per unit repression
	~	
	~		|

Framing Repression as Current Threat=
	IF THEN ELSE( Manifest Repressive Threat Tr > Repression Threshold, Protestor Framing Ability\
		 * (Manifest Repressive Threat Tr-Repression Threshold) , 0 )
	~	
	~	'repression that is excessive can create a perception of increased current threat \
		under the status quo, due to greater illegitimacy and violence from the \
		regime' pg 188
		'Excessively strong represslon can raise the perceptions of current threat' pg 189
		
		Interpret this as repression past a threshold contributes linearly to \
		current threat.

Gains that would result from success V=
	Percieved Advantages of Protest A + Percieved Current Threat
	~	
	~	pg 184
		new advantages obtained or current or prospective harms avoided
	|

Impact of Concessions on New Demands=
	0.1
	~	 [0,3,0.1]
	~	One could theorize that concessions made lead individuals to believe that \
		'change is possible', and work via the opportunity route. In the paper, \
		however, this feedback is described to go only through the 'new demands' \
		mechanism. It would be interesting to see if changing this assumption \
		would influence behavior.
	|

Initial Demands=
	1
	~	
	~		|

Making Concessions=
	IF THEN ELSE(Protest , IF THEN ELSE( Concessions < Ability to Make Concessions , Agressiveness of Response\
		 * (1-Bias towards Repression) , 0 ) , 0 )
	~	
	~		|

Manifest Current Threat Tc=
	Starting Current Threat Level - Concessions
	~	
	~	What happens if concessions exceed the initial 'current threat'?
	|

Popular Support for Protest k2=
	0.1667
	~	
	~		|

New Demands=
	Concessions * Impact of Concessions on New Demands
	~	
	~	'Modest concessions can lead to increased demands for further change, either because \
		of the de Tocqueville effect - minor changes made by the regime are an \
		advertisen1ent of its illegitimacy, but do not fully correct that \
		illegitimacy, and thus lead to greater demands for elimination or \
		transfonnation of the regime - or because the concessions attract other \
		supporters who now feel that they too can extract more from the regime.' \
		pg 188
		
		For now, assume that concessions yield a linear increase in demands.

Opposition Percieved Gains to Protest G=
	(Gains that would result from success V * Opposition Percieved Probability of Success Opportunity O\
		) - Percieved Repressive Threat Tr
	~	
	~	Pg 184:
		This fonnula involves yet another simplification - that the costs of \
		repression do not depend on the chances for success. In some cases, this \
		is clearly false - those leading a rebellion are likely to suffer far \
		greater costs if the rebellion fails than if it succeeds. However, if we \
		focus on the ordinary protestor, say the person who helped defend the \
		Russian Parliament in 1991, or the civil rights protestor who risks a \
		beating or arrest, for them the eventual result days or weeks later will \
		not change whether a bullet finds them on the barricade, or lighten the \
		beating, or avoid the arrest. For them, the immediate risks involved with \
		the act of protest itself are what counts - which is to say that leaders \
		and followers may have a separate calculus of prospective gains and risks, \
		with both being much greater for those in charge.

		of the gains.' Pg 185
		
		'We expect protest to occur if results are a net gain.' pg 184
		
		It would be interesting to make this a continuous variable, and make the \
		strength of response proportional to the strength of the protest...
