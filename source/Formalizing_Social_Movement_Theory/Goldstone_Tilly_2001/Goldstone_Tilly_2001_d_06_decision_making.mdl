		This file is essentially the mental model of an unsophisticated regime, which \
		considers only the direct impact of their policy.
		
		
		Model Assumptions:
		---------------------------
		- Individuals are rational actiors making cost/benefit decisions
	|

Cost of protest C  = A FUNCTION OF( Repressive threat Tr) ~~|
Cost of protest C=
	Manifest Repressive Threat Tr
	~	
	~		|

Current threat Tc  = A FUNCTION OF( Concessions,Initial level of current threat) ~~|
Current threat Tc=
	Starting Current Threat Level - Concessions
	~	
	~		|

Gains that would result from success V  = A FUNCTION OF( Current threat Tc,New advantages A\
		) ~~|
Gains that would result from success V=
	New Advantages of Protest A + Percieved Current Threat
	~	
	~	pg 184
		new advantages obtained or current or prospective harms avoided
	|

New advantages A=
	1
	~	
	~		|

Popular support k2=
	0.1667
	~	
	~		|

Probability of success O  = A FUNCTION OF( Popular support k2,State weakness k1,Strength of nonstate allies k3\
		) ~~|
Probability of success O=
	State weakness k1 + Popular Support for Protest k2 + Strength of nonstate allies k3
	~	
	~		|

Strength of nonstate allies k3=
	0.1667
	~	
	~		|

State weakness k1=
	0.1666
	~	
	~	'The probability of success depends on state weakness (for example, fiscal problems, \
		elite divisions, military defeat)' pg 184
		'In the short run, the group and the state probably can do little about state \
		weakness, which depends on structural conditions or events, such as \
		financial weakness, elite divisions, or military defeat.' pg 185
		
		'Weak repression or concessions can increase perceptions of state \
		weakness.' pg 189
	|

Expected net gain from protest G=
	(Gains that would result from success V * Probability of success O) - Cost of protest C
	~	
	~	Pg 184:
		This fonnula involves yet another simplification - that the costs of \
		repression do not depend on the chances for success. In some cases, this \
		is clearly false - those leading a rebellion are likely to suffer far \
		greater costs if the rebellion fails than if it succeeds. However, if we \
		focus on the ordinary protestor, say the person who helped defend the \
		Russian Parliament in 1991, or the civil rights protestor who risks a \
		beating or arrest, for them the eventual result days or weeks later will \
		not change whether a bullet finds them on the barricade, or lighten the \
		beating, or avoid the arrest. For them, the immediate risks involved with \
		the act of protest itself are what counts - which is to say that leaders \
		and followers may have a separate calculus of prospective gains and risks, \
		with both being much greater for those in charge.
