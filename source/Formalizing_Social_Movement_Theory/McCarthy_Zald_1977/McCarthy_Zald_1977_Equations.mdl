		Research Question:
		What is the theory described in McCarthy and Zald 1977
		- Is it structurally consistent
		- Can it produce the predicted behavior
		
		Theory's objective:
		- "explaining the processes of growth and decline" of social movements
		
		Scope:
		- " All SMOs that have as their goal the attainment of the broadest preferences of a \
		social movement constitute a social movement industry (SMI)" pg 1219
		- " A social movement is a set of opinions and beliefs in a population which \
		represents preferences for changing some elements of the social structure \
		and/or reward distribution of a society" pg 1217 
		- what we model has the same boundaries as what the authors term a 'social movement'
		- The terms 'Social Movement' and 'Social Movement Industry' are hard to define, and \
		the authors give significant attention to the issues associated with \
		defining the boundaries of social movements and their associated \
		industries. pg 1219-1220
		- "The social movement sector (SMS) consists of all SMIs in a society no matter to \
		which SM they are attached." pg 1220
		- "These two propositions attempt to account for the total growth of the SMS. They \
		ignore variations in the taste for change over time. They imply nothing \
		about which SMI will reap the benefits of sector expansion. Nor do they \
		imply what types of SMOs will lead the growth of an expanding SMI. They \
		explicitly ignore the relationship between the size of the SMS and the \
		intensities of preferences within a SM." pg 1225
		- " We have emphasized how [resource availability, the preexisting organization of \
		preference structures, and entrepreneurial attempts to meet preference \
		demand] seem to operate in the modern American context." pg 1236
		
		- We limit the scope of this model to a single social movement industry partly for \
		simplicity and partly because this is the level at which the majority of \
		the theory is presented. Changes to a single SMI due to changes in the SMS \
		are thus treated as exogenous to this formalization, an assumtion deemed \
		appropriate as additional presented theory indicates that changes to the \
		SMS due to broader changes in the economy present to various SMIs equally. \
		While competition between SMIs is suggested to exist, it is generally \
		subsumed to the competition between SMOs within a social movement industry.
		
		Design Choices:
		- Should the number of SMOs be modeled as a stock, or as exogenous? If modeled as a \
		stock, we have trouble differentiating between strategies. If modeled as \
		fixed, we have trouble talking about new entry...
		
		Model Assumptions:
		- "there is always enough discontent in any society to supply the grass-roots \
		support for a movement if the movement is effec-tively organized and has \
		at its disposal the power and resources of some established elite group" \
		pg 1215
		- "In any set of empirical circumstances the analyst must decide how narrowly to \
		define industry boundaries." pg 1220
		- While the theory talks about the ability to mobilize both individuals \
		and organizations in support of a movement, here we collapse the two into \
		a single concept of individuals.

		causes beyond the direct self-interest of the contributor. An individual \
		(or an organization) with large amounts of discretionary resources may \
		allocate resources to personal comfort and to the advancement of some \
		group of which he or she is not a member." p 1225-1226

		"In modern society discretion over work schedules tends to be related to larger \
		pools of discretionary income, allowing travel to distant sites as well. \
		The discretion of constituents over work schedules, then, may be seen as a \
		potential organizational resource" pg 1236
		
		"it is the preexisting control which adherents and constituents exercise \
		over their own work schedules which shapes the possibility of \
		concentration." pg 1236

		must be made concerning the allocation of these resources, and converting \
		bystander publics may not aid in the development of additional resources" \

Interaction:
	Federated, Isolated
	~	
	~	"Federation serves to organize constituents into small local units. The SMOs which \
		develop in this manner may deal with constituents directly as well as \
		through chapters or
		only through chapters." pg 1227
		
		"many SMOs do not develop chapters. These deal directly with constituents, \
		usually through the mails or through traveling field staff. The important \
		point is that constituents in non-federated SMOs do not normally meet in \
		face-to-face interaction with other constituents and hence cannot be bound \
		to the SMOs through solidary selective incentives. We term these \
		constituents, isolated constituents." pg. 1227-1228

SMO:
	SMO 1, SMO 2, SMO 3, SMO 4, SMO 5, SMO 6, SMO 7, SMO 8, SMO 9, SMO 10
	~	
	~	"A social movement organization (SMO) is a complex, or formal, organization which \
		identifies its goals with the preferences of a social movement
		or a countermovement and attempts to implement those goals." pg 1218
		
		"All SMOs that have as their goal the attainment of the broadest \
		preferences of a social movement constitute a social movement industry \
		(SMI)" 1219
	|

Benefit:
	Beneficiary, Non Beneficiary
	~	
	~	"Each of these groups may also be distinguished by whether or not they will benefit \
		directly from the accomplishment of SMO goals." pg 1221
		"Those who would benefit directly from SMO goal accomplishment we shall call \
		potential beneficiaries." pg 1221
		
		"Conscience adherents are individuals and groups who are part of the appropriate SM \
		but do not stand to benefit directly from SMO goal accomplishment.
		"Conscience constituents are direct supporters of a SMO who do not stand to benefit \
		directly from its success in goal accomplishment." pg. 1222
		
		While we could use the term 'conscience' constituent, etc, to refer to the \
		adherents who are not beneficiaries, this word loses some meaning when we \
		apply it to bystander publics. What does it mean to be a 'conscience' \
		bystander public? We will instead use the term 'Non Beneficiary' to \
		encompass the meaning of 'conscience' when applied to adherents and \
		constituents.
	|

Resource Profile:
	Mass, Elite
	~	
	~	"It is useful to distinguish constituents, adherents, bystander publics, \
		and opponents along several other dimensions. One refers to the size of \
		the resource pool controlled, and we shall use the terms mass and elite to \
		describe crudely this dimension." pg 1221
