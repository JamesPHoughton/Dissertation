		Research Question:
		What is the theory described in McCarthy and Zald 1977
		- Is it structurally consistent
		- Can it produce the predicted behavior
		
		Theory's objective:
		- "explaining the processes of growth and decline" of social movements
		
		Scope:
		- " All SMOs that have as their goal the attainment of the broadest preferences of a \
		social movement constitute a social movement industry (SMI)" pg 1219
		- " A social movement is a set of opinions and beliefs in a population which \
		represents preferences for changing some elements of the social structure \
		and/or reward distribution of a society" pg 1217 
		- what we model has the same boundaries as what the authors term a 'social movement'
		- The terms 'Social Movement' and 'Social Movement Industry' are hard to define, and \
		the authors give significant attention to the issues associated with \
		defining the boundaries of social movements and their associated \
		industries. pg 1219-1220
		- "The social movement sector (SMS) consists of all SMIs in a society no matter to \
		which SM they are attached." pg 1220
		- "These two propositions attempt to account for the total growth of the SMS. They \
		ignore variations in the taste for change over time. They imply nothing \
		about which SMI will reap the benefits of sector expansion. Nor do they \
		imply what types of SMOs will lead the growth of an expanding SMI. They \
		explicitly ignore the relationship between the size of the SMS and the \
		intensities of preferences within a SM." pg 1225
		
		- We limit the scope of this model to a single social movement industry partly for \
		simplicity and partly because this is the level at which the majority of \
		the theory is presented. Changes to a single SMI due to changes in the SMS \
		are thus treated as exogenous to this formalization, an assumtion deemed \
		appropriate as additional presented theory indicates that changes to the \
		SMS due to broader changes in the economy present to various SMIs equally. \
		While competition between SMIs is suggested to exist, it is generally \
		subsumed to the competition between SMOs within a social movement industry.
		
		Design Choices:
		- Should the number of SMOs be modeled as a stock, or as exogenous? If modeled as a \
		stock, we have trouble differentiating between strategies. If modeled as \
		fixed, we have trouble talking about new entry...
		
		Model Assumptions:
		- "there is always enough discontent in any society to supply the grass-roots \
		support for a movement if the movement is effec-tively organized and has \
		at its disposal the power and resources of some established elite group" \
		pg 1215
		- "In any set of empirical circumstances the analyst must decide how \
		narrowly to define industry boundaries." pg 1220

		The paper implies no sense of 'stockpiling' resources. While financial \
		resources could concievably be 'banked' (literally) labor resources \
