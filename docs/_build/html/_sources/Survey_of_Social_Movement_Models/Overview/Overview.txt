Overview
========

This paper will survey the existing literature of simulation models of
social movements, reconstruct these models in the System Dynamics, Agent
Based Modeling, or other paradigms as appropriate, and simulate the
range of plausible behavioral outcomes these model reveal.

It will then group these models according to their structure, underlying
theory, and behavioral outcomes.

Models of Crowds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Models of crowds are a related but probably distinct type of modeling,
as they are interested not in the macrobehavior of movements over
timescales of weeks to years, but the behavior of groups of people on
the order of minutes to hours. It will probably be important to
understand how meaningful these distinctions are, and the similarities
between each type of model.

Narrative Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Based on our previous work, looking at the conflict between narrative
explainations of events within an individual.
