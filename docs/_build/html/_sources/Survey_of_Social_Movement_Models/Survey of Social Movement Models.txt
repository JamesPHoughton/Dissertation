Survey of Social Movement Models
================================

This paper will survey the existing literature of simulation models of
social movements, reconstruct these models in the System Dynamics, Agent
Based Modeling, or other paradigms as appropriate, and simulate the
range of plausible behavioral outcomes these model reveal.

It will then group these models according to their structure, underlying
theory, and behavioral outcomes.
