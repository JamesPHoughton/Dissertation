Formalizing other social movement theories
==========================================

This paper will formalize a variety of theories about the dynamic roots
of social movements as System Dynamics or Agent Based models drawn from
the traditional sociology literature. It will focus on theories that
have received less attention in the modeling literature. It will
categorize these models according to their theories and simulated
outcomes, in the context of the categories defined for models existing
in the literature.
