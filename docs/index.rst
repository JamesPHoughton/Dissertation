Stories
-------
During this work, I hope to collect stories of individuals and groups that illustrate various components of the system, so that when the bulk of the thesis is complete, I can tell the same story – teach the same lessons – to a popular audience. Stories are the models of the mind, and so keeping a weather eye for stories that tell structure all the way through the research should facilitate this. Not only is the research likely to be a fertile ground for stories and storytelling, but if I am going to truly understand what I’m doing and have any authority on the subject, I need to be able to tell those stories.
