Case Studies
============

These case studies should identify a major area of the social movement theory, identify which of the formalized models are appropriate for analyzing it, identify one or two cases in which this area is relevant, collect data about those components of the movement, and simulate the movement with data, in order to understand if the model is a good fit for the case.
