# Dissertation

This repository tracks progress on a dissertation in the MIT Sloan School. The basic research questions are:

- What strategies from historical social movements can be applied to the climate advocacy movement?
- How do these strategies need to be adapted to the modern context?

System dynamics modeling constitutes the core methodology. The general structure is a theoretical dive into 
models of social movements in general, followed by a set of case studies drawn from history to
elaborate specific components of the system, and integration of these lessons into models of the climate
advocacy movement.
